- 👋 Hi, I’m @LilSlil
- 👀 I’m interested in generally learning to code! I'll probably have more of an idea over time, but keeping an open mind for now.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C and C++
- 💞️ I’m looking to learn how to best collaborate on future projects as I move from technical support to bulding the tech!
- 📫 Feel free to reach out!
